# Amazon-and-Flipkart-Products-Discounted-Price-Prediction

Artificial Intelligence is an integral part of all major e-commerce companies today. Today's online retail platforms are heavily powered by algorithms and applications that use AI. Machine learning is used in a variety of ways, from inventory control and quality assurance in the warehouse to product recommendations and sales demographics on the website.

Letâ€™s say you want to create a promotional campaign for an e-commerce store and offer discounts to customers in the hopes that this might increase your sales.

We have been provided descriptions of products on Amazon and Flipkart, including details like product title, ratings, reviews, and actual prices. In this challenge, you will predict discounted prices of the listed products based on their ratings and actual prices.

Machine Learning algorithms used:
 1. XGBoost Regressor
 2. RandomForest Regressor
 
 Roor Mean Square Error is used as Evaluation Metric, which is 170.01 here.
